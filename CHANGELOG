==================
- Update of SHARE metadata question pertaining to licensing of metadata. Question now reads:

The data/metadata you are providing is in the public domain or can be distributed under a CC0 license; license of the data/metadata only applies to the information in the feed, not content linked from the feed (i.e. full-text journal articles linked in the metadata would not need to be public domain/CC0 license).
